@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="This equation is actually from quantum mechanics. ``It's called Schrödinger's Time-Dependent Wave Equation'', named after the awesome Austrian physicist Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger. Yep, the ``Schrödinger's cat'' guy. Pretty cool dude actually, check his wiki page: \protect \url  {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schrodinger}. He was physics' no. 1 Ladies' man if there ever was one. Anyway, you will learn more about this equation in FYS2140. You can also find it printed on a glass wall in the UiO Physics Building (it really is that important)."}
